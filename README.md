# SIMPLE SHELL BASICS
Projects done in teams of two people during our study at ***Alx software engineering programme***.

**For this project we had to take a close look at these concepts;**
- <a href ="https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/64"><code>Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell</code></a>.
- <a href ="https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/350"><code>Approaching a Project</code></a>.

## During this project

```c
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```
